A super interesting data visualization of the Palmer Penguins data set.
In this post, I will share an interesting result I found from the Palmer Penguins data set based on the results of my final project in PIC16A.


## Data Acqusition and Filtering
First, we must import the Palmer Penguins data set
```python
import pandas as pd
url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PhilChodrow/PIC16B/master/datasets/palmer_penguins.csv"
penguins = pd.read_csv(url)
```

Our goal will be to try and determine what species of penguin a data point is based on some measurements the data provides. Here we will filter out three columns that are useful in determining what their species: "Island", "Culmen Length (mm)", "Body Mass (g)".
```python
penguins = penguins[["Species", "Island", "Culmen Length (mm)", "Body Mass (g)"]]
penguins["Species"] = penguins["Species"].str.split().str.get(0)
```


## Explatory Analysis
Below is a summary table of the penguins data based off the columns we selected:
```python
def penguin_summary_table(group_cols,value_cols):
    return penguins.groupby(group_cols)[value_cols].mean().round(2)
penguin_summary_table(["Species", "Island"], ["Culmen Length (mm)", "Body Mass (g)"])
```

From this, we can vaguely follow a Decision Tree in order to guess what species a penguin could be by taking the average of measurements:
```python
def decision_tree(island, mass, culmen):
    # if the penguin lives on Biscoe island and has a body mass of over 4350 g, guess that it's a Gentoo penguin
    if island == "Biscoe":
        if mass > 4350:
            return "Gentoo"

    # if the penguin lives on Dream island and has a culmen length of over 44 mm, guess that it's a Chinstrap penguin
    elif island == "Dream":
        if culmen > 44:
            return "Chinstrap"

    # otherwise, guess it's an Adelie penguin
    else:
        return "Adelie"
```

In other words, we picked columns that maximize differences between the average species measurements and then further filtered them via island. This decision tree model is further supported by the results of our visualization.


## Data Visalization
Based on the columns that we have selected, if we plot the culmen length of a penguin against its body mass we achieve this scatter plot:
```python
fig, ax = plt.subplots(1, figsize=(8,6))
ax.set(xlabel = "Culmen Length (mm)",
    ylabel = "Body Mass (g)")

species = set(penguins["Species"])

for s in species:
    # filtering the culmen and body data points into individual lists
    sub_culmen = penguins[penguins["Species"] == s]
    sub_culmen = sub_culmen["Culmen Length (mm)"].dropna()

    sub_body = penguins[penguins["Species"] == s]
    sub_body = sub_body["Body Mass (g)"].dropna()

    # ensure that neither of these lists are empty
    if sub_culmen.empty: continue
    if sub_body.empty: continue

    # plotting the scatter plot
    ax.scatter(sub_culmen, sub_body, label="%s"%(s.split(' ')[0]), alpha=0.5)

ax.legend()
```

As you can see, we can cluster the penguins by species based off these measurements. This information was vital in the completion of the rest of our project as we were able to gain a better intuition on what factors go into determing a penguins species and train a better model in order to this more accurately.

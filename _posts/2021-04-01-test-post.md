I'm an super awesome incredible fantastic jaw-dropping PIC16B student and I am running Jekyll! 

This is a header:
### Third level header (number of # controls level)

Numbered List:
1. One
2. Two
3. Three

This is an equation:
$$f(x) = e^x$$

This is a short code block:
`np.random.rand()`

This is a long code block:
```python
def f(x):
    """
    A cool function that multiples an input x by 2. 
    """
    return 2*x
```

More long code blocks:
```
print("to boldly go")
```

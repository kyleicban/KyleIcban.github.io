title: My Exciting HW1 Post
---

A super interesting report with interactive data graphics using the NOAA climate data.
In this post I will share incredible visualizations that could be used to understand climate change over the years in different countries.

Listed below are the packages we will use:
```python
import pandas as pd
import seaborn as sns 
from matplotlib import pyplot as plt
import numpy as np
import sqlite3
from plotly import express as px
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
```

## Create a Database

First, we will use `sqlite3` in order to create a database with three tables: `temperatures`, `stations`, and `countries`.

Creating the temperatures table and cleaning it:
```python
temp_csv = "./temps.csv"
temperatures = pd.read_csv(temp_csv)

temperatures = temperatures.set_index(keys=["ID", "Year"])
temperatures = temperatures.stack()
temperatures = temperatures.reset_index()
temperatures = temperatures.rename(columns = {"level_2"  : "Month" , 0 : "Temp"})
temperatures["Month"] = temperatures["Month"].str[5:].astype(int)
temperatures["Temp"]  = temperatures["Temp"] / 100
temperatures["FIPS"] = temperatures["ID"].str[0:2]
temperatures.head()
```

Creating the stations table and cleaning it:
```python
station_csv = "./station-metadata.csv"
stations = pd.read_csv(station_csv)

stations = stations.drop(["STNELEV"], axis=1)
stations["FIPS"] = stations["ID"].str[0:2]
stations.head()
```
![stations_table.png](/images/HW1/stations_table.png)

Creating countries table and creating it:
```python
# using different csv from online to obtain 3 letter ISO
countries_csv = "./iso-country-codes.csv"
countries = pd.read_csv(countries_csv)

countries = countries.drop(["Numeric code", "ISO 3166-2"], axis=1)
countries = countries.rename(columns = {"English short name lower case" : "Name", "Alpha-2 code" : "FIPS", "Alpha-3 code" : "ISO"})
countries.head()
```
![countries_table.png](/images/HW1/countries_table.png)

Creating the database:
```python
temperatures.to_sql("temperatures", conn, if_exists = "replace", index = False)
stations.to_sql("stations", conn, if_exists = "replace", index = False)
countries.to_sql("countries", conn, if_exists = "replace", index = False)

cursor = conn.cursor()
cursor.execute("SELECT name FROM sqlite_master WHERE type='table'")
```

### First Graphic
## Write a Query Function

In order to create these incredibly interesting graphics, it will be useful to create unique query functions in order to select specific data from our database.
Here, we create a query function that returns a dataframe with the station name, the latitude of the station, the longitude of the station, the name of the country in which the station is located, the year in which the reading was taken, the month in which the reading was taken, and the average temperature at the specified station during the specified year and month.

```python
def query_climate_databases(country, year_begin, year_end, month):
    '''
        Parameters:
            country: The country we want to query
            year_begin: lower year bound
            year_end: upper year bound (inclusive)
            month: The month we want to query
        Returns:
            A dataframe with all the station names within our country, 
            the resepctive latitude and longitude coords, country name, year,
            month, and temperature recorded during that month.
    '''

    cmd = \
    """
    SELECT S.NAME, S.LATITUDE, S.LONGITUDE, C.Name AS Country, T.Year, T.Month, T.Temp
    FROM stations S
    LEFT JOIN countries C ON S.FIPS = C.FIPS
    LEFT JOIN temperatures T ON S.ID = T.ID
    WHERE C.Name = '{0}' AND T.Year >= {1} AND T.Year <= {2} AND T.Month = {3};
    """.format(country, year_begin, year_end, month)
    
    df = pd.read_sql_query(cmd, conn)
    
    return df

query_climate_databases(country="India", 
                    year_begin=1980, 
                    year_end=2020, 
                    month=1)
```

## Write a Geographic Scatter Function for Yearly Temperature Increases

Now that we've written our query function, we proceed to write a geographic scatter graphic. Based on what we query, it will plot a dot at the location of each station and also provide information regarding the average temperature that was recorded.

First, we create useful functions:

```python
months = {
    1 : "January",
    2 : "February",
    3 : "March",
    4 : "April",
    5 : "May",
    6 : "June",
    7 : "July",
    8 : "August",
    9 : "September",
    10 : "October",
    11 : "November",
    12 : "December"
}
def get_month(index):
    return months[index]

def coef(data_group):
    '''Returns the Linear Regression coefficient of the data_group'''
    x = data_group[["Year"]]
    y = data_group["Temp"]
    LR = LinearRegression()
    LR.fit(x, y)
    return round(LR.coef_[0], 4)
```

And now the function:

```python
def temperature_coefficient_plot(country, year_begin, year_end, month, min_obs, **kwargs):
    '''
        Parameters:
            country, year_begin, year_end, month: same as above
            min_obs: each station must have at least 'min_obs' entry points
                to be plotted
        Returns:
            A figure of a geographic scatter plot.
    '''

    df = query_climate_databases(country=country, year_begin=year_begin, year_end=year_end, month=month)
    
    df = df[df.groupby(["NAME"])["Year"].transform(len) >= min_obs]
    df = df.groupby(["NAME", "LATITUDE", "LONGITUDE"]).apply(coef)

    df = df.reset_index()
    df = df.rename(columns = {0 : "Estimated Yearly\nIncrease (째C)"})
    
    title = """
    Estimates of yearly increase in temperature in {0} for stations in {1}, years {2} - {3}
    """.format(get_month(month), country, year_begin, year_end)
    
    fig = px.scatter_mapbox(df, 
                        lat = "LATITUDE",
                        lon = "LONGITUDE", 
                        hover_name = "NAME", 
                        color = "Estimated Yearly\nIncrease (째C)",
                        color_continuous_midpoint=0,
                        title = title,
                        **kwargs)
    
    return fig

color_map = px.colors.diverging.RdGy_r

fig = temperature_coefficient_plot("India", 1980, 2020, 1, 
                                   min_obs = 10,
                                   zoom = 2,
                                   mapbox_style="carto-positron",
                                   color_continuous_scale=color_map)
fig.show()
```

### Second Graphic
## Write a Query Function

Here, we build our second query function that returns a dataframe that will be used to 
create global choropleth of the average temperatures recorded in a year in different countries.

```python
def query_climate_databases_2(year):
    '''
    Parameters:
        year: the year which we want to query
    Returns:
        A dataframe that contains the 3-letter ISO of a country and
        the average temperature of the year in each country
    '''

    cmd = \
    """
    SELECT C.ISO AS Country, AVG(T.Temp) AS `Average Temperature (째C)`
    FROM temperatures T
    LEFT JOIN countries C ON T.FIPS = C.FIPS
    WHERE T.Year = {0}
    GROUP BY C.Name
    """.format(year)
    
    df = pd.read_sql_query(cmd, conn)
    df = df.drop(0)
    
    return df
query_climate_databases_2(year=1994)
```
![query_02.png](/images/HW1/query_02.png)

## Write a Global Choropleth Function for Average Yearly Temperatures

Finally, we build a function that plots a choropleth plot of countries around the world. Each country is color coordinated to reflect
the average temperature they received from that year. NOTE: Countries without any data are colored a muted grey.

```python
def temperature_choropleth(year, **kwargs):
    df = query_climate_databases_2(year=year)
    
    fig = px.choropleth(df, 
                    locations="Country", 
                    color="Average Temperature (째C)",
                    color_continuous_scale=px.colors.diverging.BrBG,
                    color_continuous_midpoint=0,
                    title=f"Average Temperature of Countries in {year}",
                    **kwargs)
    
    return fig

fig = temperature_choropleth(year=1994)

fig.show()
```
![figure_02.png](/images/HW1/figure_02.png)

### Third Graphic
## Write a Query Function

Our third and final query function will be used to find temperature anomolies a given station recorded at any given point in time.
In order to do this, we will use a function to calculate a plot point's z-score:

```python
def z_score(x):
    m = np.mean(x)
    s = np.std(x)
    return (x - m)/s
```

And now the query function. Note: this query function determines the size of each plot point in our eventual scatter plot by using the z-score.
The size is equal to the absolute value of the z-score raised to the fifth power. This makes the plot points with z-score less than 1 essentially irrelevant,
so that those with z scores greater or equal to 1 only appear.

```python
def query_climate_databases_3(station):
    '''
        Parameters:
            station: The station which we want to query
        Returns:
            A dataframe that contains the station name, each year and month the station recorded data,
            the corresponding temperature plot point, the corresponding z-score and a calculated size parameter. 
    '''

    cmd = \
    """
    SELECT S.NAME, T.Year, T.Month, T.Temp
    FROM temperatures T
    LEFT JOIN stations S ON T.ID = S.ID
    WHERE S.Name = "{0}"
    """.format(station)
    
    df = pd.read_sql_query(cmd, conn)
    df["z"] = df.groupby(["NAME", "Month"])["Temp"].transform(z_score)
    df["Date"] = pd.to_datetime(df["Year"].astype(str) + "-" + df["Month"].astype(str))
    
    df["size"] = np.abs(df["z"]**5)
    
    return df
query_climate_databases_3("AMUNDSEN_SCOTT")
```
![query_03.png](/images/HW1/query_03.png)

## Write a Scatterplot Function for Visualizing Temperature Anomolies

Finally, we build a function that plots a scatterplot of all the different temperatures recorded.
In particular, it highlights all temperatures with a high or low z-score.

```python
def temperature_anomalies(station):
    '''
        Paramters:
            station: The station which we want to query
        Returns:
            A figure of a scatterplot of all the temperature points recorded by the provided
            station, highlighting all the anomolies.
    '''

    df = query_climate_databases_3(station)

    fig = px.scatter(df[df["NAME"] == station], 
                x = "Date", 
                y = "Temp",
                color = "z",
                size = "size",
                title = f"Temperature Anomalies at {station}")
    
    return fig
    
fig = temperature_anomalies("AMUNDSEN_SCOTT")
fig.show()
```
